Othello Game Using Python

AI-Based Strategic Board Game


---

Project Overview

This project is an AI-enhanced version of the traditional Othello board game, developed as a part of our Department's PBL Exhibition 2025 at Ajeenkya D Y Patil School of Engineering, Pune.

Our system uses powerful AI techniques to make gameplay smarter, more adaptive, and challenging for the players.

Algorithms Used:

Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning:
Optimizes decision-making by minimizing opponent chances and cutting unnecessary branches.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):
Simulates multiple random plays to determine the best move strategy.

Reinforcement Learning (RL):
Enables continuous learning and adaptation based on past gameplay moves.

How to Play Othello:

The game is played on an 8x8 board between two players (or AI vs player).

Players place discs of their color (black or white) on the board.

A move is valid only if it captures at least one of the opponent’s discs by flanking them horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The captured discs are flipped to the player’s color.

The objective is to have more discs of your color than your opponent when the board is full or no valid moves are left.


Important Tip: Control the corners and edges — they give strong advantage!
